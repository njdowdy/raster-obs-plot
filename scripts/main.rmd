## Summary of Input Data

The file "input/specieslist.csv" contains a list of 3685 North American species of Hymenoptera. This file contains:
  1. Species Name
  2. Corresponding Family
  3. Corresponding Number of Occurrence Records

Spatial polygons have been previously generated for each taxon and are composed of two files with extensions ".grd" and ".gri". The corresponding files for each taxon are stored in:

1. `../input/extracted/range_data_rasters/family_Predicted/220km/genus species_raster.grd`
2. `../input/extracted/range_data_rasters/family_Predicted/220km/genus species_raster.gri`

** Note: these are stored in a .7z archive in the repository and need to be extracted

## Code Requirements

Read in each range file, calculate the area of each polygon (see area() in *raster* package), add the calculated area to the csv document. 

* Loop over species
* Read in raster
* Measure area of range
* Write out in in new columns of "specieslist.csv":
  * Range size
  * Range size as a proportion of continental US area (?)
  * Total number of records needed (this would be the 8 mil records) (?)
  * New records added (total records needed - current records) (?)
* Based on number of "New Records Added", generate N random lat/long points within each species' range
* Export generated lat/longs into a csv file for each corresponding taxon

```{r echo=FALSE}
df <- as.data.frame(read.csv(input_csv_location))
datatable(df, extensions = "Scroller", width = 1000, options = list(scrollY = 200, scroller = TRUE, scrollX = 200, pageLength = 1))
```
